                <h1>Introduction: A little about me.</h1>
                <p>I am originally from Cape Girardeau MO. In college I picked up playing disc
                    golf as a way to get outside with some friends. After college I moved to St. Louis and then to Blue
                    Springs. These are some of the course I liked best from around the state.</p>

                <h1>Fun courses in Southeast Missouri.</h1>
                <p>We'll start our trip in the place most of you will likely never go. It's 5 hours away, and you would
                    probably only pass through here if you are trying to get to Memphis. Feel free to skip this section.

                <h3>Cape County Park</h3>
                <p>This was the first course I ever played. It has a lot of holes in the woods; which is not kind to
                    beginners. My disc would bounce off trees like a pinball. Still, this is one of my favorite courses.
                    Most of the holes are fun, and the park is very pretty. Lots of rude geese though.</p>

                <h3>Scott County Park</h3>
                <p>A 10 minute drive south of Cape is Scott City. This course has a good mix of holes in the woods and
                    long drives. A word of warning though; Some of the later holes have pretty steep drop offs. They can
                    be
                    frustrating, and you might lose a disc.</p>

                <h1>Fun Courses in St. Louis</h1>
                <p>Next up is St. Louis. Not much to say about the place. They have a good baseball team
                    <em>(usually)</em> and a hockey
                    team that finally managed to win the Stanley cup. Don't think I'm knocking the blues though. They
                    once had Brett Hull <strong>AND</strong> Wayne Gretzky. Pretty rad.</p>

                <h3>Carrolton Disc Golf Course</h3>
                <p>This one is neat. The city of St. Louis was trying to expand the airport, so they drove thousands of
                    people out of the Carrolton subdivision. They then never developed it and decided to put in a disc
                    golf course. The whole park is full of flat terraces that go up and down hills. You can tell where
                    houses
                    used to stand. It feels like playing in a weird ghost town. Also, planes fly over like every 20
                    minutes.</p>

                <h3>Jefferson Barracks Park</h3>
                <p>This park is a bit hilly. Pack some water, and maybe some almonds. The park is set up to use the
                    hills for interesting holes. I really like this one. Bonus: If you go near sunset, a scary amount of
                    deer
                    come out and just start grazing. They aren't afraid of humans, and that scares me a little bit.
                    <strong>Fun Fact:</strong> More people die from deer than sharks in a given year. It's mostly car
                    accidents, but still.</p>

                <h1>Fun courses in the Kansas City area</h1>
                <p>Finally some information you can use. If you read through all of the other entries, congratulations.

                <h3>Water Works</h3>
                <p>When you ask around what peoples' favorite course is in KC, this is one that comes up a lot. It
                    has a nice view looking over the city. It uses wooded areas really well. It is an absolute blast.
                    The only bad thing is how many <em>steep</em> hills there are. Like climbing straight up a hill,
                    steep. The first
                    time I played it I wasn't expecting it,
                    and I could only get through the front 9. I would still go back though. It is one of the prettiest
                    courses I've been to.</p>

            <article>
                <h3>Legacy Park</h3>
                <p>This one is my favorite in the area. The front 9 has a lot of long bombs. The back 9 are mostly
                    technical shots in a nice shady area. It has a little of something for everyone. It isn't too hilly.
                    It has a lot of good shade. It is hard to lose a disc. If you are looking for a place to start, I'd
                    start here.</p>

                <h1>Final Thoughts</h1>
                <p>There are so many more great courses out there. If you've never given disc golf a shot, I hope this
                    has
                    made you reconsider. A set of discs will set you back 30 bucks, but then you get to explore some
                    parks
                    in a truly unique way.</p>
